# Caesar Cipher

## Description
Caesar Cipher is a command line application built entirely using java languange and intellij IDE.
<br>
In very simple terms... this application is used to encrypt plain text based on a selected shiftkey of integers between 1 an 25 so as to form a cypher text which can only be decoded by the person (s) involved. <br> <br>
The application can as well decrypt encrypted message into plain text.

## Behaviour Driven Development
BDD focuses on the expected user experience with the app.
<br>
As the creator the intended functionality for this application is that the user will:
<br>
1. Enter the message to encrypt or decrypt.
2. Specify the shifykey.
3. Get expected output.

The application has undergone junit testing to ensure it works as expected.
